# üî¨ Emergence Simulator - Engineering Documentation

## Overview

This document details the technical implementation of morphic resonance in artificial systems, focusing on the novel engineering approaches that enable genuine pattern-based collective memory in cellular automata. The current implementation features a FastAPI-based web application with SQLite database backend, integrated LLM decision-making via OpenRouter API, and comprehensive pattern similarity analysis using multi-metric algorithms.

## üß¨ Morphic Resonance Implementation

### Core Architecture

The morphic resonance system operates through a multi-layered architecture:

1. **FastAPI Web Server** (`main.py`) - RESTful API endpoints for simulation control and data access
2. **Integrated Run Engine** (`integrated_runs.py`) - Core simulation logic with morphic resonance implementation
3. **Analysis Engine** (`analysis_engine.py`) - Real-time data analysis and visualization generation
4. **Pattern Similarity Core** (`core/pattern_similarity.py`) - Multi-metric pattern matching algorithms
5. **Database Layer** (`storage/`) - SQLAlchemy models with SQLite backend for persistent storage

Unlike traditional cellular automata that apply fixed rules, this implementation creates dynamic rule modification based on historical pattern memory through real-time similarity analysis and LLM-enhanced decision making.

### Pattern Storage and Memory Crystals

**Crystal Structure:**
```python
crystal = {
    'patterns': [],           # List of 50 most successful patterns
    'strength': float,        # Bayesian posterior probability [0,1]
    'creation_time': datetime,
    'success_count': int,     # Pattern recognition successes
    'total_activations': int, # Total pattern consultations
    'markov_chains': {}       # Pattern ‚Üí pattern transition probabilities
}
```

**Pattern Data Structure:**
```python
pattern_data = {
    'generation': int,
    'grid': numpy.ndarray,    # Full 2D structural representation
    'subpatterns': {          # Multi-scale pattern decomposition
        3: [...],            # 3x3 subgrids
        5: [...],            # 5x5 subgrids
        7: [...]             # 7x7 subgrids
    },
    'population': int,
    'activity_score': float,
    'timestamp': str,
    'outcome': str           # 'stable' or 'dynamic'
}
```

### Multi-Metric Pattern Similarity

The system employs three complementary similarity calculations:

1. **Hamming Distance** (30% weight)
   - Direct bit-by-bit comparison
   - Optimal for exact pattern matches
   - `similarity = 1 - (hamming_distance / total_cells)`

2. **Convolution Analysis** (40% weight)
   - Translation-invariant pattern detection
   - Identifies shifted or rotated patterns
   - Uses normalized cross-correlation

3. **Subpattern Analysis** (30% weight)
   - Multi-scale pattern decomposition
   - Compares 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 subgrids
   - Enables partial pattern recognition

**Final Similarity Score:**
```python
similarity = 0.3 * hamming_sim + 0.4 * conv_sim + 0.3 * subpattern_sim
```

### Adaptive Neighborhood Scaling

The system automatically adjusts neighborhood size based on pattern complexity:

```python
def get_adaptive_neighborhood(grid, i, j, grid_size, pattern_scale):
    if pattern_scale <= 3:
        size = 1  # 3x3 neighborhood
    elif pattern_scale <= 5:
        size = 2  # 5x5 neighborhood
    else:
        size = 3  # 7x7 neighborhood

    return grid[max(0, i-size):min(grid_size, i+size+1),
                max(0, j-size):min(grid_size, j+size+1)]
```

This ensures optimal pattern matching at appropriate scales and prevents mismatch between small patterns and large neighborhoods.

### Cell-Level Decision Integration

Every cell decision follows this priority hierarchy:

1. **LLM Consultation** (similarity > 0.8)
   - OpenRouter API call with pattern context
   - 95%+ influence probability
   - 3-second timeout with fallback

2. **Markov Prediction** (historical transitions)
   - Pattern ‚Üí pattern transition modeling
   - Weighted by crystal strength and similarity
   - Memory-efficient with 50-pattern limit per crystal

3. **Conway Rules** (baseline fallback)
   - Standard Game of Life rules
   - Applied when no morphic influence found

### Bayesian Learning Algorithm

Crystal strengths update using Bayesian posterior calculation:

```python
# Prior: current crystal strength
prior = crystal['strength']

# Likelihood: pattern success rate
likelihood = pattern_successes / total_pattern_uses

# Evidence: normalization across all crystals
evidence = sum(likelihood_i * prior_i for all crystals)

# Posterior: updated strength
posterior = (likelihood * prior) / evidence
learning_rate = 0.1
crystal['strength'] = (1 - learning_rate) * prior + learning_rate * posterior
```

This creates genuine learning where successful patterns strengthen over time while unsuccessful patterns decay.

### LLM Integration Technical Details

**API Implementation:**
```python
def query_llm_for_decision(context):
    response = requests.post(
        "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        json={
            "model": "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are analyzing Conway's Game of Life for morphic resonance. Respond only '0' or '1'."
                },
                {"role": "user", "content": context}
            ],
            "max_tokens": 3,
            "temperature": 0.1
        },
        timeout=3.0
    )
    return int(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip())
```

**Context Generation:**
- Current neighborhood state (live cell count)
- Historical pattern similarities and outcomes
- Previous decision success rates
- Morphic field strength indicators

### Uncapped Influence System

Unlike the original implementation with arbitrary 80% influence caps, the enhanced system allows:

- **Perfect Patterns (similarity = 1.0)**: 100% influence probability
- **Near-Perfect (similarity > 0.9)**: 90%+ influence
- **LLM Decisions**: 95%+ influence regardless of similarity
- **High Similarity (0.6-0.9)**: Proportional influence scaling

This enables genuine morphic dominance where perfect pattern matches can completely override Conway's rules.

## üîß Technical Sensitivities and Considerations

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Management:**
- Pattern storage limited to 50 patterns per crystal
- Only top-20 recent patterns checked for similarity
- Automatic cleanup of old/unused patterns

**Computational Efficiency:**
- Similarity calculations vectorized with NumPy
- Top-3 similarity matches used for influence decisions
- Markov chain transitions limited to essential states

**API Rate Limiting:**
- 100ms delays between LLM calls
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- Local caching of common LLM responses

### Statistical Validation

The system implements comprehensive validation:

```python
# Structural pattern validation
assert isinstance(pattern['grid'], np.ndarray)
assert 0 <= similarity <= 1
assert sum(markov_probabilities) == 1.0

# Influence correlation tracking
correlation = np.corrcoef(similarities, influences)[0,1]
assert correlation > 0.3  # Minimum correlation threshold
```

### Scientific Rigor Measures

1. **Deterministic Pattern Matching**: All influence decisions traceable to specific pattern similarities
2. **Control Group Isolation**: Pure Conway simulations run alongside morphic ones
3. **Statistical Significance**: Batch processing for significance testing
4. **Reproducibility**: Complete data provenance and result serialization
