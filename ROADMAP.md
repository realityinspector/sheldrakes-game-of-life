# 🗺️ Morphic Field Phenomenology - Roadmap

## Vision

Build a computational framework to characterize morphic field signatures, generate synthetic morphic data at scale, and train ML models to detect morphic-like patterns in time series—enabling systematic investigation of what collective memory effects would look like in measurable systems.

---

## Phase 1: Comparative Simulation Framework ✅

**Status**: Complete

- ✅ Three simulation modes (morphic, LLM-control, classical)
- ✅ Pattern memory via crystals with multi-scale similarity
- ✅ Visualization pipeline (GIFs, charts, frame-by-frame comparison)
- ✅ Web interface and historical viewer
- ✅ Initial findings: memory-induced population collapse

**Key Insight**: Pattern memory constrains exploration, leading to instability—a genuine empirical finding about memory vs evolution tradeoffs.

## Phase 2: Time Series Data Generation 🔄

**Goal**: Generate large-scale synthetic morphic field data with controlled parameters

**Deliverables**:
- Parameter sweep framework (field strength, decay rates, coupling coefficients)
- 1000+ simulation runs with varied morphic properties
- Structured time series format (JSON) with consistent metrics
- Control runs (no morphic field) for baseline comparison
- Cross-system coupling experiments (runs influence each other)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Population dynamics, complexity evolution, pattern diversity
- Morphic influence rate, crystal utilization, resonance events
- Temporal autocorrelation, pattern recurrence frequency
- Inter-run similarity (for cross-system resonance detection)

**Implementation**: Extend existing simulation engine with parameterized morphic field controls and batch processing capabilities.

## Phase 3: ML Morphic Field Detector 🎯

**Goal**: Train models to recognize morphic signatures in time series

**Approach**:
1. **Feature extraction** from time series (autocorrelation, decay profiles, clustering metrics)
2. **Classification task**: Morphic field present (yes/no)
3. **Regression task**: Estimate field strength from dynamics
4. **Embedding analysis**: What patterns do morphic fields create in latent space?

**Models to Train**:
- Time series transformers (attention over temporal patterns)
- 1D CNNs for pattern detection in metrics
- Recurrent architectures (LSTM/GRU) for sequential dependencies
- Contrastive learning to separate morphic from control in embedding space

**Success Criteria**: 
- >85% accuracy distinguishing morphic from control runs
- Field strength estimation within ±0.15 of ground truth
- Interpretable features (what signals indicate morphic influence?)

## Phase 4: Cross-Domain Application 🌐

**Goal**: Apply morphic detectors to other systems and potentially real data

**Experiments**:

1. **Other Cellular Automata**: Langton's Ant, Brian's Brain, Wireworld
2. **Different Grid Topologies**: Hexagonal, toroidal, 3D
3. **Real Complex Systems** (exploratory):
   - Flocking simulations (Boids)
   - Neural network training dynamics
   - Social media cascades
   - Market time series (price/volume patterns)

**Research Questions**:
- Do morphic signatures generalize across substrates?
- Can we detect memory-like effects in natural time series?
- What distinguishes morphic patterns from standard autocorrelation?

## Long-Term Vision 🔭

**Morphic Field Physics Analyzer**: A tool that takes any time series and outputs:
- Probability of morphic-like influence (0-1 score)
- Estimated field parameters (strength, decay, coupling)
- Temporal heatmap showing influence events
- Comparison to baseline null model

**Potential Applications**:
- Scientific tool for detecting collective memory effects
- Benchmark for testing hypotheses about non-local correlation
- Educational demonstration of emergence and memory
- Framework for AI research on meta-learning and pattern reuse

## Success Metrics

**Phase 2**: 1000+ high-quality simulation runs with full time series data
**Phase 3**: Publishable ML model achieving >85% detection accuracy
**Phase 4**: Detector successfully applied to ≥3 different CA systems

**Ultimate Goal**: Transform "Does morphic resonance exist?" into "What would it look like, and can we measure those patterns?"

---

## Timeline (Estimated)

- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks (parameter sweep infrastructure + data generation)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks (feature engineering + model training + analysis)
- **Phase 4**: Ongoing research (depends on findings from Phase 3)

*This is a research roadmap, subject to revision based on empirical findings. The goal is rigorous phenomenology, not proof of metaphysical claims.*
