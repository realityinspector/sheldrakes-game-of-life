# 🌊 Morphic Field Phenomenology Lab

**A computational laboratory for characterizing what morphic fields would look like if they existed**

Rather than trying to prove or disprove Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, this project takes a different approach: *What patterns and signatures would morphic fields produce in measurable systems?* Can we build detectors for those signatures?

## 🎯 Core Concept

This is **phenomenology, not metaphysics**. We're not claiming morphic fields are real—we're creating "toy morphic fields" in cellular automata to:

1. **Generate synthetic morphic data** with known parameters (field strength, decay rates, cross-system coupling)
2. **Characterize morphic signatures** (temporal autocorrelation, pattern recurrence, influence clustering)
3. **Train ML detectors** to recognize morphic-like patterns in time series data
4. **Compare against controls** to understand what makes morphic dynamics distinctive

Think of it as: *"If physicists can predict gravitational wave signatures before detecting them, can we predict morphic field signatures before looking for them in real systems?"*

## 🧬 What We've Found So Far

**Key Finding**: Pattern memory can destabilize systems. Our initial experiments show:

- **Morphic simulations** (with pattern memory) experience 22% population collapse
- **Classical simulations** (pure Conway rules) remain stable
- **Implication**: Memory without exploration leads to premature convergence

This suggests morphic-like mechanisms create distinctive dynamics—memory constrains the search space, preventing discovery of stable attractors that pure evolution finds naturally.

## 🔬 Current Implementation

### Three Simulation Modes

1. **Morphic** - Pattern memory influences cell decisions via "crystals" (successful pattern storage)
2. **LLM-Control** - AI consultation for high-similarity patterns (>0.8 similarity threshold)
3. **Classical** - Pure Conway's Game of Life baseline

### Pattern Memory Mechanism

- **Multi-scale analysis**: 3×3 → 5×5 → 7×7 adaptive neighborhoods
- **Similarity metrics**: Hamming distance + convolution + subpattern matching
- **Bayesian learning**: Crystal strength updates based on success rates
- **Influence system**: Perfect pattern matches can achieve 100% rule override

### Visualization & Analysis

- Real-time animated comparisons (morphic vs control vs classical)
- Frame-by-frame analysis with morphic influence markers
- Population dynamics, complexity evolution, pattern diversity tracking
- Statistical summaries and correlation analysis

## 📊 Research Applications

This framework enables investigation of:

- **Memory vs exploration tradeoffs** in evolutionary systems
- **Pattern emergence** under different influence regimes
- **Cross-system resonance** (do independent runs converge?)
- **Temporal dynamics** of collective memory formation
- **Threshold effects** in pattern-influenced systems

Relevant to:
- Machine learning (overfitting, catastrophic forgetting)
- Evolutionary algorithms (exploitation vs exploration)
- Self-organizing systems (stigmergy, collective intelligence)
- Cultural evolution (tradition vs innovation)

## 🎯 Roadmap

**Phase 1** (Current): Comparative simulation framework with visualization
**Phase 2**: Time series data generation and feature extraction
**Phase 3**: ML detector training ("morphic field signature" classifier)
**Phase 4**: Cross-domain application (other cellular automata, real data)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed vision and [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for implementation specifics.
